# Data-Story-Telling
Contains my work around finding meanings through visualizations of different kinds of data.
Recently I have been playing around with data(big, small) a lot to understand what it has to offer and trying to narrate my version of the story created from the data. This repo contains my work where I tried the art of story telling using MS Excel as a medium.
